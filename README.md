# VBA-Challenge
Pls find in this repo the one combined script (per homework instructions) with the VBA code to generate the data for 2018-2020 in text. format. It is called "Denoncour-VBA-Script-Module2Challenge_2023_07-10.txt." Also find powerpoint with three screenshots of each worksheet called "Denoncour-Mod2Challenge-Screenshots2.pptx." This is code I created using lessons.
